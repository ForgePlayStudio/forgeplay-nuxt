The game revolves around creating a small, candy-themed world where the player (child) must face enemies (candies). To defeat these enemies (eat them), the player needs to empower their hero using magical math answers!
Each correct answer to a magical math spell will grant a buff to the player's hero, enabling them to deal more damage.
The game will be tested by elementary school teachers during development to ensure continuous feedback from children.
