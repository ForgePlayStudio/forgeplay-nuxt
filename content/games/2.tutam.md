Thanks to this infinity run, the player can take control of a black sphere and face an epic challenge. The sphere runs on a randomly generated road, located at incredible dizzying heights. The road is very narrow and features a series of challenging curves, which require great driving skills from the player. In addition, the sphere must jump over gaps and dodge obstacles to stay alive as long as possible.

The game also features a series of increasingly difficult levels that put the player's driving skills to the test. The challenge becomes more and more demanding as progress is made, and the player must be ready to continually improve their driving skills to succeed.

TuTam is a must for fans of challenging and engaging games. The challenge is extremely rewarding and the graphics and soundtrack are simply spectacular. If you're ready to face a real challenge, this game is perfect for you!
