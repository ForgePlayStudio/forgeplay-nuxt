The game involves the discovery of characters from Italian folklore.
Players will explore regions of Tuscany where mythical creatures, never seen before, have settled! Using folklore stories from various cities, players will discover clues to locate the creature's area. They will explore, investigate, and even engage in combat if necessary!
To solve puzzles and fights you will use mechanics inherent to the cards, these mechanics allow you to find objects by ambiguing cards with NPGs and fight thanks to defensive and offensive cards!
