The Last Whisper is a psychological horror game that combines player psychology, folklore and cultural fears, offering a compelling experience developed with the Unreal Engine.

In this first-person game, players are immersed in a dark narrative where their choices and imagination create true terror.

Set in a cursed and ever-changing village on the edge of an ancient forest, players must investigate a series of disappearances while dealing with supernatural forces and the darker aspects of their psyche.

The story explores deep psychological themes and intertwines folklore and myth, reflecting on universal fears such as guilt, anguish, betrayal and the unknown.

The protagonist's beliefs about the meaning of life are strongly questioned during this experience, leading the player to experience 3 different extreme endings.
